# Moses
TODO: Stick build badge here. Also make some continuous integration thingy

The only open source way to convert GMSH to Exodus nodesets et. all. Designed for programs like Seacas and Goma.

For more information on this and my other projects, please see the website.


### Building Moses
Don't. Wait for me to actually have a decent version of this up and running and then build it. But until then I will continue coding.

### License information
Moses, like all my other one man projects, is licensed under the GPLv3. It basically means you can reuse this code in your open source projects (or personal ones) as long as you keep it open source. If you want to use this code but not distribute it (editing it for your own benefit), the GPL allows you to do so. Fork my projects and let's make the best Exodus generator around.

### What does the name stand for?
Nothing. It's a pun because it generates exodus(II).
